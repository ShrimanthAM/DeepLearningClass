        "1. Modify  `LanguageNameDataset` the so that the `vocabulary` object in the constructor does not need to be passed in as an argument, but instead can be _inferred_ from the input dataset. This means you will need to iterate through the dataset, and create a dictionary with all of the characters _actually seen_. One way to implement this is to create a default value  `vocabulary=None`, and use `is vocabulary None:` to change behavior. \n",
        "2. Update the `LanguageNameDataset` with a flag in the constructor for `unicode=False`. You should change any of the code you need to so that when `unicode=True`, the `LanguageNameDataset` will instead keep all the unicode characters seen when `vocabulary=None` (this depends on question 1). Train a new RNN classifier with `unicode=True`, how does it impact the results?\n",
        "4. The original training/test split for this task was created by randomly sampling the dataset. Create your own function that performs _stratified_ splitting. This means it will select a test set that has the exact same proportions of each class. How does this impact your apparent results?\n",
        "5. Replace the last output layer `nn.Linear(hidden_nodes, classes)` from the RNN implementation with a fully-connected network with 2 hidden layers and one output layer. How does this impact the accuracy of the model?\n",
        "7. Compare training a 3-layer bidirectional RNN with batch sizes of $B=\\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$ for 5 epochs. Which batch size seems to give the best balance between speed and accuracy? "
